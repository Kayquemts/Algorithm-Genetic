# Genetic Algorithm for Hyperparameter Optimization in Machine Learning Models
This repository contains the implementation of a genetic algorithm for hyperparameter optimization in various Machine Learning models. The algorithm uses techniques of natural selection, crossover, and mutation to explore and find optimal combinations of hyperparameters, aiming to improve model performance.

## What is the genetic algorithm?
A genetic algorithm is an optimization technique inspired by the principles of natural selection and genetics. It is used to find approximate solutions to complex search and optimization problems. 

## how the genetic algorithm works
The image below illustrates the process of a genetic algorithm, let's imagine that the turtles are the hyperparameters of a model.

### 1. Evaluation of Each Individual:

* Each turtle (individual) is assessed based on a fitness function to determine how well it performs a given task. This step evaluates the quality of each solution in the population.

### 2. Selection:

* Turtles with higher fitness scores are selected for reproduction. This mimics the natural selection process where the fittest individuals are more likely to pass on their genes to the next generation.

### 3. Reproduction:

* Selected turtles mate to produce offspring. This step involves combining the genetic material (genes) of two parents to create new individuals (offspring) that inherit traits from both parents.

### 4. Mutation:

* Some offspring undergo random mutations, introducing new genetic variations. This step helps to maintain genetic diversity within the population and allows exploration of new potential solutions.

### 5. New Generation:

* The new generation of turtles, including both offspring and mutated individuals, forms the new population. This new population will undergo the same cycle of evaluation, selection, reproduction, and mutation.

The process repeats over several generations, gradually evolving the population toward better solutions.
